            <h3>Adobe Photoshop</h3>
                <p>The two programs I’m most familiar with are Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, as I work as a freelance 
                    graphic designer. I was self-taught and initially, I used photoshop to create mindless images. However, 
                    as time went on I began to realize the potential of these programs. Throughout the years I’ve attained 
                    an advanced understanding of using photoshop and illustrator.
