            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Kevin and here I’ll provide you background information about myself. 
                I am an ESFJ personality, emphasizing social interactions and environments. As a result, I like to play 
                team-based sports such as soccer. Not only do I play the sport, but I also enjoy watching the sport. 
                I regularly watch the premier league and support the Tottenham Hotspurs. Furthermore, I love listening to music. 
                I don’t have a preference for genres, however, I commonly listen to r&b artists such as; Bryson Tiller.

        <h2>Why I Chose This Class</h2>
            <p>The reason why I chose this course is that I want to further my knowledge of different code formats and 
                how user interfaces are created. Moreover, this also provides me with an opportunity to learn more about 
                the backend of programming. I believe that this course will allow me to broaden my future career path, being 
                able to use the skills in future work fields.

            <h2>Graphics</h2>
            <p>Currently, I work as a freelance graphics designer. I pride myself on minimalistic, yet meaningful designs. 
                I work with Adobe programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Recently, I’ve even branched out and started 
                creating Web Pages for my clients. Down below are some of my previous projects.
