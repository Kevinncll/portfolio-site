                <h3>Adobe Photoshop</h3>
                    <p>The two programs I’m most familiar with are Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, as I work as a freelance 
                        graphic designer. I was self-taught and initially, I used photoshop to create mindless images. However, 
                        as time went on I began to realize the potential of these programs. Throughout the years I’ve attained 
                        an advanced understanding of using photoshop and illustrator.

                <h3>Adobe XD</h3>
                    <p>I’m not the most experienced with web creation and wireframes, however, I recently challenged myself and 
                        began taking requests for web development. The tools in comparison to photoshop were much simpler to use. 
                        However, I found it difficult to switch between Photoshop shortcuts and Adobe XD shortcuts.

                <h3>Building a Computer</h3>
                    <p>One of my most memorable experiences with technology is when I built my own computer. I purchased a plethora of different parts such as the RAM, GPU and CPU to create a fully functional computer. For a while, I wanted to build a faster computer than my current one. I decided it would be a better choice to build my own computer as it was cheaper then buying one from Dell for example.
